This custom SDL lib is based on this [commit](https://github.com/devkitPro/SDL/tree/077bac3730f8c244d609695592abc404dd415fd2) from DevkitPro's SDL port. The changed files (currently only one) are in `Changes`. This basically is the old software rendering SDL with the new Vi and Framebuffer apis. This custom build is needed because opengl doesn't work in the OverlayDisp context
